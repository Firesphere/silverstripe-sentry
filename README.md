[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is an error and exception aggregation service. It takes your application's errors and stores them for later analysis and debugging. 

Imagine this: You see exceptions before your client does. This means the error > report > debug > patch > deploy cycle is the most efficient it can possibly be.

This module binds Sentry.io and locally-hosted Sentry installations, to the error & exception handler of SilverStripe. If you've used systems like 
[RayGun](https://raygun.com), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com), [AirBrake](https://airbrake.io/) and [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) before, you'll know roughly what to expect.
